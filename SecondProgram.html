<p>In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.</p>
          
         <p> More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data
          There are numerous types of data structures.</p>


        <p>Array and linked list are  most important data structures.</p>  

          <p>An array is a number of elements in a specific order, typically all of the same type (depending on the language, individual elements may either all be forced to be the same type, or may be of almost any type). Elements are accessed using an integer index to specify which element is required. 
          Typical implementations allocate contiguous memory words for the elements of arrays (but this is not always a necessity). Arrays may be fixed-length or resizable.</p>

          <p>A linked list (also just called list) is a linear collection of data elements of any type, called nodes, where each node has itself a value, and points to the next node in the linked list. The principal advantage of a linked list over an array is that values can always be efficiently inserted and removed without relocating the rest of the list. Certain other operations, such as random access to a certain element, are however slower on lists than on arrays.</p>
